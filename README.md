# Declarative Programming Streams

A list of active (see [active](#active) for how we define active) declarative programming streams:

  - Speaking: EN
  - Programming Languages: Haskell
  - Schedule: Tue at 8:10pm EST - [full schedule on twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/agentultra/schedule)

##### Active

The term "active" considers two components: frequency and consistency. The list
should consider streamers with a good frequency (>=1 stream per month) but
consistency is important for many folks. Look for schedules or links to a
schedule for consistent streamers.

##### Contributing

Streamers should be actively streaming on Twitch.

Streaming should be focused on functional or logic programming.

If you focus mostly on one language feel free to make it bold.

Add your stream to [streamers.json](streamers.json). All fields are required.

```json
{
  "name": "your-channel-name",
  "channel": "https://twitch.tv/your-channel-name",
  "speaking": ["EN"],
  "languages": ["Haskell", "**PureScript**"],
  "schedule": "Your schedule. [Can cointain markdown links](https://schedule.com) and __formatting__"
}
```

Submit a PR with your changes to `streamers.json` and the CI will autogenerate
a `README.md` when it hits master.

#### Previously Active Streams

Here is a list of previously active streamers. Please open up a PR to make
yourself active again
